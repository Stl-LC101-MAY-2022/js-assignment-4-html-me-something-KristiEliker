               <h2>Dragon Age Inquisition</h2>
               <p> I love Dragon Age Inquisition for its world-building, emotion, and excellent open world gameplay. It takes me away to another world every time I play it. I adore the characters, and trying out every combination of classes and races. Adventuring across Thedas never gets tiring, nor does going through the epic story of the Inquisitor!</p>

               <h2>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</h2>
               <p>The greatest trilogy of video games ever made.  Hundreds of planets to interact with, places to explore, and people to meet make this a game that never feels empty and wanting to search every nook and cranny for more. The combat is exciting, fun, and incredibly creative, allowing you to always find a way to win that you'll enjoy. The storyline and lore is stunning and by the end of the series you'll be left breathless. It's worth every second.</p>

                  <h2>Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete</h2>
                  <p>Lunar was one of the pivotol moments in gaming for me and I first played it as a sophomore in high school. This is your quintessential, absolutely famous JRPG and it made a huge impact on the gaming community. Over a hundred hours of gameplay, 6 characters you play and get to know, and a wonderful world all culminate in this beautiful and emotional classic story about love and good vs evil. This game made me fall in love with RPGs and lead me down the path to absolute videogame nerd. </p>

                  <h2>Rune Factory 4</h2>
                  <p>Rune Factory 4 was the perfect and ultimate symbiosis of Farming Simulator and ARPG with a rich company history to boot. This game includes farming, crafting, cooking, alchemy, forging, combat, dungeons, exploration, running a store, home decoration, and even romance. This game hits every single thing anyone could want out of an RPG and was a huge cult classic in America, though Harvest Moon went on to be a much bigger company and Rune Factory's company went bankrupt. Not enough to save the company, but an amazing game regardless.</p>

                  <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</h2>
                  <p>A game and series that changed the future of video games as we know it, you may think that Link is actually Zelda but almost everyone has at least heard of this classic. A huge leap forward in graphics alongside Mario 64, they dug into 3D camera mechanics and gave you a more immersive world than you'd had in Zelda before. The combat is fun with a huge variety of weapons, the puzzles are challenging and exciting, and the boss battles keep you on your toes. It's so iconic that most people have negative opinions of water temples and water levels BECAUSE of this game. 10 out of 10.</p>

                  <h2>Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King</h2>
                  <p>Though all Dragon Quest games are a mix of challenge, rage, and total adoration, VIII took it to another level with the alchemy pot and monster catching ability. A huge following in Japan, DQ8 is Dragon Quest at its best - a beautiful storyline that nudges you forward without forcing it down your throat, hilarious yet endearing characters, and a grand journey to cure your lands' King of his curse as an elderly.. frog... person? Who knows, but he's precious, and he and the horse keep you company throughout your journey, providing laughs and advice as your navigate your way through the game. VIII out of 8. </p>

                  <h2>Pokemon Y</h2>
                  <p>If you don't know what Pokemon is then I don't know where you've been but it was a dark, sorrow filled place. Pokemon as a series is amazing, but X and Y introduced precious Pokemon such as Goomy and Sylveon, Mega Evolution as a concept, and the thing we all really cared about: clothes. The sheer amount of clothes in this game is staggering and it allows you to really customize your trainer and truly feel like you're playing the game. A new region with new places to explore, wonderful starting Pokemon (hey Litleo), and another installment in a mega franchise we all know and love. </p>

                  <h2>Total War: Warhammer 3</h2>
                  <p>Total War: Warhammer 3 is one of my favorite games because it presents fantasy battles on a scale unheard of, with a host of memorable and awesome characters built on decades of lore. I enjoy the empire building aspects, growing settlements, and conquering terroritories as I spread my forces across the Old World. There there's the real time battles, where thousands of soldiers clash in epic confrontations. Dragons, giants, and many more terrifying beasts fight against brave soldiers and powerful wizards on expansive battlefields. There's nothing else like it.</p>

                  <a name="subnautica"></a>
                  <h2>Subnautica</h2>
                  <p>I love Subnautica for its challenge and for its atmosphere. The world of Subnautica holds so many wondrous discoveries and bizarre creatures. Its even scary, with man-eating beasts roaming the deeps as you descend further and further. Navigating the submarine through narrow passages is tense and rewarding, and the game ends with a memorable and satisfying rocket launch as you escape the planets clutches. For now.</p>

                  <h2>Gauntlet Legends</h2>
                  <p>Gauntlet Legends was not only one of my first ever experiences with a genuine arcade cabinet game, but it's also the first arcade game I ever beat in one sitting. It takes hours and it's so much fun with a friend, because there's absolutely nothing like the joystick combat and combos. As a kid it became my entry point to the world of games not just outside the home, but outside of consoles in general, and taught me I enjoyed free combat in games.</p>
